## Front End:

### Branding:
**Do you need an app icon?**
  - Unknown

**Do you need a digital logo?**
  - No

**Do you need mobile licensed brand image assets?**
  - If you'd like to have a user-centeric experience, I'd suggest purchasing high-res mobile stock photography. Otherwise, we can discuss other options. Modern mobile design trends are typically either completely flat UI or very image heavy to provide the best user experience for their content.
  - There are [free options](https://unsplash.com/search/fitness) as well as [paid-by-license](http://www.istockphoto.com/photos/spin-class?excludenudity=true&mediatype=photography&page=1&phrase=spin%20class&sort=best) services available for us to discuss.
